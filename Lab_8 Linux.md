### 1.	Use the ping command to test the connectivity to a remote server (e.g., example.com).

```bash
$ ping google.com
PING google.com (142.250.192.14) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from bom12s14-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.192.14): icmp_seq=1 ttl=119 time=23.4 ms

```

### 2.	Write a script to measure the round-trip time for each packet and analyze the results.

```bash

```

### 3.	Use the traceroute to trace the route packets take to a destination

```bash

```

### 4.	Analyze the output to identify any potential bottlenecks or points of failure in the route.

```bash

```

### 5.	Use the nslookup command to find the IP address of a given domain (e.g., example.com).

```bash

```

### 6.	Use the netstat command to view active connections and listening ports on your machine.

```bash

```

### 7.	Use the ifconfig (Linux) or ip a command to display network interface configurations.

```bash

```

### 8.	Write a script to report document the configuration of each interface, noting the IP address, subnet mask, and any other relevant information.

```bash

```

### 9.	Perform a basic network scan using nmap on your local network to identify active devices and open ports.

```bash

```

### 10.	Create a report summarizing the devices found, their IP addresses, and the services running on the open ports.

```bash

```

### 11.	Capture network packets using tcpdump on a specific interface.

```bash

```

### 12.	Analyze the captured packets for specific protocols (like HTTP or DNS) and summarize your findings.

```bash

```

### 13.	Use the whois command to gather registration information about a domain.

```bash

```

### 14.	Use the hostname command to display and change the hostname of your machine.

```bash

```

### 15.	Use the finger command to gather information about users on a system.

```bash

```

### 16.	Use the who command to see who is currently logged into the system and the last command to view the login history.

```bash

```
